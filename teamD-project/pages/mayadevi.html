       <h1>The Story of Maya Devi Temple: A Journey Through Time</h1>
       <p>The Maya Devi Temple in Lumbini, Nepal, is one of the most sacred sites in Buddhism, marking the exact place where Queen Maya Devi gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama, who later became Buddha. Over 2,500 years ago, Queen Maya Devi was traveling to her maternal home when she stopped in Lumbini to rest. Enchanted by the beauty of the grove, she bathed in a serene pond, walked through the gardens, and, while holding onto the branch of a Sal tree, gave birth to her son. This moment, which would go on to shape the spiritual history of the world, is now commemorated by the Maya Devi Temple.</p>
       <p>The earliest known temple at this site was built during the Mauryan period (3rd century BCE) when Emperor Ashoka, a great patron of Buddhism, visited Lumbini. To mark the birthplace of Buddha, he erected the famous Ashokan Pillar, which still stands today with an inscription confirming Buddha’s birth in Lumbini. Over the centuries, the temple and surrounding monasteries flourished, particularly during the Gupta Empire (4th–6th century CE) and Nepal’s Licchavi period (5th–9th century CE). Pilgrims from all over Asia visited Lumbini, making it a thriving center of Buddhist worship. However, as Buddhism declined in Nepal, the temple fell into neglect, and by the 15th century, it was largely forgotten, covered by layers of earth and jungle.</p>
        <p>The temple remained hidden until 1896, when a Nepalese general, Khada Shumsher Rana, and German archaeologist Dr. Alois Anton Führer rediscovered the Ashokan Pillar, proving beyond doubt that this was the birthplace of Buddha. Over the next century, excavations uncovered the ruins of ancient stupas and temples. In the 1990s, archaeologists made an even more astonishing discovery—beneath the existing structure, they found a brick temple dating back to around 550 BCE, making it one of the oldest Buddhist temples ever found.

            Today, the modern Maya Devi Temple carefully preserves these ancient ruins. Inside, visitors can see a stone relief depicting Maya Devi holding the Sal tree as she gives birth, as well as the Marker Stone, which pinpoints the exact birthplace of Buddha. The Puskarini Pond, where Maya Devi is believed to have bathed before giving birth, remains an important pilgrimage site. The temple is surrounded by the Lumbini Garden, where monks chant peacefully and pilgrims from all over the world come to meditate.
            
            Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997, Lumbini and the Maya Devi Temple continue to attract thousands of visitors every year. More than just an ancient monument, the temple is a symbol of peace, wisdom, and enlightenment, reminding the world of Buddha’s humble beginnings. To walk through its sacred grounds is to step into history, where emperors, monks, and seekers of truth have come for over two millennia. If you ever visit, you may feel the deep spiritual energy that makes this quiet grove in Nepal one of the most important places in the world.</p>
