       <h1>Ashoka Pillar in Lumbini: A Legacy of Peace and Devotion</h1>
       <p>Imagine walking through the sacred grounds of Lumbini, where the air is filled with a sense of history and spirituality. Among the ancient ruins stands a tall, weathered stone pillar, a silent witness to over 2,000 years of devotion. This is the Ashoka Pillar, built in 249 BCE by Emperor Ashoka, one of history’s most remarkable rulers. After years of conquest, Ashoka embraced Buddhism and made a pilgrimage to Lumbini—the very place where Prince Siddhartha Gautama was born. To mark this sacred site, he ordered the construction of this beautiful sandstone pillar, ensuring that future generations would know its importance.</p>
       <p>What makes this pillar truly special is its inscription, written in Brahmi script, which directly confirms that Buddha was born here. The words, carved over two millennia ago, still echo Ashoka’s deep reverence:</p>
       <p class="design">"King Piyadasi (Ashoka), beloved of the gods, in the 20th year of his reign, personally visited this place and worshiped it because here Buddha, Shakyamuni, was born."</p>
       <p>Standing about 6 meters (20 feet) tall, the Ashoka Pillar has survived centuries of history, wars, and natural disasters. Today, it is carefully preserved within an iron fence, surrounded by peaceful gardens where monks chant and visitors pause to reflect. For Buddhists, historians, and travelers alike, this pillar is more than just an ancient monument—it’s a symbol of truth, enlightenment, and the journey of a king who chose peace over war. Whether you’re a pilgrim seeking spiritual connection or simply someone fascinated by history, standing before the Ashoka Pillar is like touching the past, a reminder of Buddha’s timeless teachings and the emperor who helped spread them across the world.</p>
