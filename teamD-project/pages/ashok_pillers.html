            <h3>Ashoka Pillar</h3>
            <h1>Ashoka Pillar: A legacy of peace and devotion</h1>
            <p>Imagine walking through the sacred grounds of Lumbini, where the air is filled with a sense of history and spirituality. Among the ancient ruins, one structure stands tall and proud, weathered stone pilllar, a silent witness to over 2,000 years of devotion. This is the Ashoka Pillar, built in 249 BCE by Emperor Ashoka, one of history's most remarkable rulars. After years of conquest, Ashoka embraced Buddhism and made a pilgrimage  to Lumbini-the very place where Prince Siddhartha Gautama Buddha was born. To mark this sacred site, he ordered the consturction of this beautiful sandstone pillar, ensurng that future generation would know its importance.</p>
            <P>What make this pillar truly special is its inscription, written in Brahmi script, which directly confirms that Buddha was born here. The word carved over two Millennia ago still echo Ashoka's deep reverence</P>
            <p>"King Piyadasi (Ashoka), beloved of the gods, in the 20th year of his reign personally visited this place and worshiped it because here Buddha, Shakyamuni was born</p>
            <p>Standing about 6 meters (20 feet) tall, the Ashoka Pillar has survived centuries of history, wars and natural disasters. Today, it is carefully preserved within an ron fence, surronded by peacefull gardens where monks chant and visitors pause to reglect. For Buddhists, historians and travelers alike, this pillar is more than just and ancient monument-it is a symbol of truth, enlightement and journey of a King who choose the path of peace over violence. As you stand before the Ashoka Pillar, you can't help but feel a deep connection to the past, a reminder that even in a world of chaos, the message of compassion and understanding can endure.</p>
