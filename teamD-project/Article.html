            that Buddha himself identfied four places of future pilgrimages: the sites of his birth, Enlightement,
            First Discourse, and death. In the Buddha's time, Lumbiniwas a beautiful garden full of green and shady
            sal trees <a style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 18px">(shorea robusta)</a>. The garden and its tranquil
            environs were owned by both the Shakyas and the clans. Kind suddhodhana, father of Siddharth Gautama Buddha,
            was of the Shakyas dynasty and belonged to the <a style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 18px">kshatriya (warrior clans)</a>
